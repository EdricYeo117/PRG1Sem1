-String method operators-
isalpha () is to check if a string contains only characters (no numbers, no spaces, no special characters) and is not empty
isalnum() to check if a string containts characters or digits and is not empty (alphanumerical)
isdecimal() to check if a string contains digits and is not empty 
lower() to get a lowercase version of a string
islower() to check if a string is lowercase
upper() to get an uppercase version of a string
isupper() to check if a string is uppercase
tilt() to get a capitalized version of a string
startswith() to check if the string starts with a specific substring
endswith() to check if the stirng ends with a specific substring
replace() to replace a part of a string
split() to trim the whitespace from a string
join() to append new letters to a string
find() to find the positon of a substring
len() to find the length of a string
index() to find the positon of a character in a string (with respect as the most left to 0)

-Variable Indexing-
use variable[] to grab a specific character from a string 
when using variable [x:y], it is inclusive of x, exclusive of y


use "\" to take raw string
use "\n" to make new line
use "\\" to add backslash, as backslash cancels out

-Boolean-
True
False
all(<only true if all true>)


-Complex numbers LOL-
complex = x + yj
num = complex(x,y)

print(num.real, num.imag)

-Built in functions for python numerical manipulation-

abs() -> gives the absolute value of a number (disregards if negative or positive)
round(<value>, <precision>) -> rounds the number off

-Enums-
from enum import enum
class Sate(enum):
 INACTIVE = 0
 ACTIVE = 1
print(State.ACTIVE)
